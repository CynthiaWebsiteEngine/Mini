# CynthiaWebsiteEngine-mini

Simplified version of CynthiaWeb. Not supporting most of the features.
Simply put, goal is to run a really
simple server here, serving static stuff and having the client do the rest.

This leaves a lot of customization options in the bin,
as for example custom formats are out of the optional.

## Functionality

CynthiaWeb-mini has Functionality that moves away from the enormous
[CynthiaWebSiteEngine](https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/CynthiaWebSiteEngine)
has, and instead takes an approach closer to that of the original `strawmelonjuice.PHP` engine.

The configuration structure is also simplified, it now consists of markdown files and their corresponding metadata files in json. Global configuration is done in the `config.json` file.
