# And a special thanks to

- [Fontlay](https://fontlay.com/): Allowing for the themes in Cynthia Mini to have nice fonts without having to bother Google with it. In the future, Cynthia-Mini will bring it's own fonts, like it brought the sqljs wasm before. But Fontlay has allowed me to focus on what is important _first_.
- [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/): Enables the entire comment functionality for Cynthia Mini.
- [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) and [Lustre](https://github.com/sponsors/hayleigh-dot-dev), in which Cynthia Mini was built.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) being the javascript runtime AND bundler to make Mini run smoothly

.. forgot about you? Tell me!
